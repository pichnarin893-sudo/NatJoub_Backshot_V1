## 1. Overview

At NatJoub, we understand that plans change. This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions for canceling your room booking and receiving a refund. Please read this policy carefully before making a booking.

---

## 2. Cancellation Request Process

### 2.1 How to Request a Cancellation

To cancel your booking and request a refund:

1. **Log in** to your NatJoub account
2. Navigate to **"My Bookings"**
3. Select the booking you wish to cancel
4. Click **"Request Cancellation"**
5. Provide a **reason for cancellation** (optional but recommended)
6. Submit your request

### 2.2 Owner Approval Required

**All cancellation requests require approval from the property owner.** Your refund is not guaranteed and is subject to the owner's decision. The owner will review your request and:

- ✅ **Approve** - Your booking will be cancelled and refund processed
- ❌ **Reject** - Your booking remains active and no refund is issued

You will receive a real-time notification when the owner makes their decision.

### 2.3 Minimum Cancellation Window

**Cancellation requests must be submitted at least 2 hours before your check-in time.**

- ✅ **Allowed:** Requesting cancellation 2+ hours before check-in
- ❌ **Not Allowed:** Requesting cancellation less than 2 hours before check-in
- ❌ **Not Allowed:** Requesting cancellation after check-in time has passed

---

## 3. Refund Calculation

### 3.1 Time-Based Refund Tiers

If your cancellation is **approved by the owner**, your refund amount is calculated based on how far in advance you requested the cancellation:

| Time Before Check-In | Refund Percentage | Example (₹100 booking) |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **More than 48 hours** | 100% | ₹100.00 |
| **24 to 48 hours** | 75% | ₹75.00 |
| **6 to 24 hours** | 50% | ₹50.00 |
| **2 to 6 hours** | 25% | ₹25.00 |
| **Less than 2 hours** | ❌ Cannot cancel | ❌ Not allowed |

### 3.2 Payment Gateway Fees

**A 2% payment gateway processing fee will be deducted from your refund.**

This fee covers the cost of processing the original payment and the refund transaction.

**Example Calculation:**
```
Booking Amount:        ₹100.00
Refund Tier (24-48h):  75% = ₹75.00
Gateway Fee (2%):      -₹2.00
Final Refund:          ₹73.00
```

### 3.3 Refund Estimate Display

When you submit a cancellation request, you will see an **estimated refund amount** based on the current time and your booking's check-in time. This is the amount you will receive **if the owner approves** your request.

---

## 4. Promotional Codes & Discounts

### 4.1 Promo Code Restoration

If your booking used a promotional code and your cancellation is **approved**, the promotional code usage will be **restored** to your account, allowing you to use it again for a future booking.

### 4.2 Discount Amount in Refund

Your refund will be calculated based on the **discounted price** you actually paid, not the original room price.

**Example:**
```
Original Room Price:   ₹150.00
Promo Code (20% off):  -₹30.00
Amount You Paid:       ₹120.00
Refund Tier (75%):     ₹90.00 (75% of ₹120.00)
Gateway Fee (2%):      -₹2.40
Final Refund:          ₹87.60
```
